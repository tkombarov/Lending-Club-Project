# Data Exploration, Credit Modeling and Loan Pricing using Lending Club Data

This project is designed to show the variety of utility that can be derivied from the same dataset. This exercise is using Lending Club loan origination data to analyse origination trends as well as the performance of the loans. 
From the modeling perspective there are several things that can be done, we will be looking at how to predict the defaults in addition to trying to understand the loan pricing method of the lender. 
I have no affiliation with the above mentioned company, the dataset was discovered by me in 2017 when it was available on the Lending Club website, as of right now this data cannot be accessed anymore.
